# ms-doc-refactoring

Taking example code from [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/) and applying [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/) style refactoring on them.

The goal of this project is to learn, demonstrate, and exercise refactoring practices.

# General Practices

* Start with a working example from [Microsoft's docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/)
* Add [unit tests](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) to capture the behaviour of the example
* Iteratively identify [code smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html) and fix them with refactorings
* Document any lessons learned
